# Digital library 📝

Digital libraries are Internet sites consecrated to the creation and preservation of electronic book collections and holdings of other kinds of materials, without the need for end users to purchase the materials they want to consult and read.

# Project submission ✨

This is my project submission for the creation of a digital library LIS322

# Set up and Run the code 🎗

Clone the repo with the command line:

```
```

Then change to the root directory:

```
cd digital-library
```

You can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python index.py
```
This will create the digital library directory and add the three books to the library. You can then view the library metadata by opening the metadata file in a text editor.
